Currently, I am a Charge Reconciliation Analyst within the Revenue Cycle Department for Radiology Partners. My responsibilities consist of analyzing and compiling large sets of data to ensure that reconciliation of charges match. With any inconsistencies, I work with 3rd party vendors and internal departments to ensure any missing data is retrieved and reconciled. The results from the analysis

With a large customer driven background, I bring the expertise of analyzing processes and data to companies on both the business and customer ends of the spectrum.

Prior achievements include building out a Revenue Cycle team, implementing structure within the department, and leading a team of 12 that supported Patient Access and Claim Management efforts.

My skills are best utilized in project management and data analytics. They also include:
